Awasu API
=========

``awasu_api`` is a set of wrapper classes and utilities around the `Awasu API <http://awasu.com/api>`_, that allows you to automate Awasu e.g.

- Querying Awasu *e.g. what channels or reports or workpads are present, and their latest content, running search queries.*
- Configuring Awasu *e.g. creating new channels or reports or workpads, or changing their configuration.*
- Controlling Awasu *e.g. triggering reports, adding new content to workpads.*

A tutorial is available `here <http://www.awasu.com/weblog/awasu-api/>`_.
