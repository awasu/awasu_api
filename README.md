# Awasu API

`awasu_api` is a set of wrapper classes and utilities around the [Awasu API](<https://awasu.com/api>), that lets you automate Awasu e.g.
- querying Awasu e.g. what channels or reports or workpads are present, and their latest content, running search queries.
- configuring Awasu e.g. creating new channels or reports or workpads, or changing their configuration.
- controlling Awasu e.g. triggering reports, adding new content to workpads.
